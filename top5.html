    <h2>My Favorite Characters</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Wayne</h3>
            <img src="Wayne_Letterkenny.jpg" alt="Wayne from Letterkenny" width="300">
            <p>
                Of course I absolutely adore the star of the show! Wayne is tough guy with a big 
                heart who only wants to protect what he loves most - his sister, his friends, and 
                his dogs!
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Shoresy</h3>
            <img src="Shoresy_Letterkenny.jpg" alt="Shoresy from Letterkenny" width="300">
            <p>
                Shoresy is not in the show often enough! He is witty and fun character who does 
                nothing but spit out quips, especially towards Riley and Jonesy, his hockey teammates.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Rosie</h3>
            <img src="Rosie_Letterkeny.jpg" alt="Rosie from Letterkenny" width="300">
            <p>
                Rosie is my favorite of Wayne's Partners. She is kind-hearted and will do anything 
                to help an animal in need. I love a gal who loves animals as much as I do!
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Katy</h3>
            <img src="Katy_Letterkenny.jpg" alt="Katy from Letterkenny" width="300">
            <p>
                Katie is Wayne's sister. They are a lot alike in the way that they only want to 
                protect and help those they love. She's a spunky and rebellious spirit with a lot 
                of heart!
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Squirrelly Dan</h3>
            <img src="SquirrellyDan_Letterkenny.jpg" alt="Squirrelly Dan from Letterkenny" width="300">
            <p>
                Dan is just hard not to love with his constant mispronunciations and teddy bear 
                like nature. I would love to gets some "sushis and sashimis" with this guy any day!
