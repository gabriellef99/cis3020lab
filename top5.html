    <h2>My Favorite Characters</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Wayne</h3>
            <img src="https://i.redd.it/694ad9yeuxq21.jpg" alt="Wayne" width="300">
            <p>
                Of course I absolutely adore the star of the show! Wayne is tough guy with a big 
                heart who only wants to protect what he loves most - his sister, his friends, and 
                his dogs!
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Shoresy</h3>
            <img src="https://www.looper.com/img/gallery/who-plays-shoresy-on-letterkenny-and-why-dont-you-ever-see-his-face/intro-1691117087.webp" alt="Shoresy" width="300">
            <p>
                Shoresy is not in the show often enough! He is witty and fun character who does 
                nothing but spit out quips, especially towards Riley and Jonesy, his hockey teammates.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Rosie</h3>
            <img src="https://www.geekgirlauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/d24_ep610_6.jpg" alt="Rosie" width="300">
            <p>
                Rosie is my favorite of Wayne's Partners. She is kind-hearted and will do anything 
                to help an animal in need. I love a gal who loves animals as much as I do!
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Katy</h3>
            <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRJ_ll7i3oliFAxL8usSkY1sLdoh4bbUxw2Wg&s" alt="Katy" width="300">
            <p>
                Katy is Wayne's sister. They are a lot alike in the way that they only want to 
                protect and help those they love. She's a spunky and rebellious spirit with a lot 
                of heart!
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Squirrelly Dan</h3>
            <img src="https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/letterkenny-dan.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=1008&h=693&dpr=1.5" alt="Squirrelly Dan" width="300">
            <p>
                Dan is just hard not to love with his constant mispronunciations and teddy bear 
                like nature. And that's what I appreciates about him. I would love to gets some "sushis and sashimis" with this guy any day!
